The boilerplate webpack contains a branch all configuration as I need them at my stage. 
It contains babel, babael polyfil, boostarp library, jquery and popper.js which boostrap needs; contains moment.js, uuidv4 library. 
contains a commentd css suplimentary file. 
all the dependecy and folders are setup. 
when starting a new project, just take notes of what you need, and then clear the library you don't need and run npm install. 
then, there are two main optin: npm run start which does not create files in dist folder but starts the dev server and all the files are created virtual. you can find them in source console. 
second, when all is ready run npm run build and all the final product is printed in dist folder, minifyed and functional.
